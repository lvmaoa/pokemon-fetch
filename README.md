# Pokemon fetch

Fetches pokemon data from https://pokeapi.co/. Build with `make main` in src.

Issues:
- [ ] Pokemon name is malformed after fetching

TODO: 
- [ ] Extend functionality to items and pokemon data not just pokemon
- [ ] Print more data returned pokemon
- [ ] Add modifiers and shortcuts (in progress)

Not sure why/how `yzhang.rocky@gmail.com` created the first commit, might be because I had used certain parts of his neovim config relating to git stuff.
