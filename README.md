# Pokemon fetch

Fetches pokemon data from https://pokeapi.co/. Build with `make main` in src.

Issues:
- [ ] Pokemon name is malformed after fetching

TODO: 
- [ ] Extend functionality to items and pokemon data not just pokemon
- [ ] Print more data returned pokemon
- [ ] Add modifiers and shortcuts (in progress)
